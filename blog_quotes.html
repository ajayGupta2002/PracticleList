<h1> motivational quotes </h1>
<hr>
<p> What is it about motivational quotes that make them so endearing? Every driven person eventually figures out that there's a whole lot of feel-good time wasters out there that consume our attention because they feel like work, and browsing endless lists of motivational quotes is no exception. And yet, there's hidden value in finding a concise expression that perfectly captures one of our own beliefs.
<br/>
Quotes often feel like our own opinions making a return visit, just heightened by someone with writing talent. And the right quote at the right time can change things—words matter, and motivating phrases can encourage us to get up, take action, ditch the excuses, escape our comfort zone, and do the hard work that needs doing.
Even genuinely successful people show some reverence to a favorite inspirational quote or two—to get through hard times, to remember an important personal principle, or even just to get ready to face the day. In business and life, quotes are short bits of wit and wisdom that are easy to revisit when we need them.
That said, here are a few of our favorite quotes from a wide variety of sources. We hope you find a few you like and can <strong> revisit often. </strong> </p>
